The USDA published a report in 2014 finding that 31 percent, or 133 billion pounds, of food in the US went uneaten with a loss value of about $110 billion solely at the consumer level. Don’t Waste It! is an iOS app created to combat food waste and provide a practical tool for users about their soon-to-expire foods. It provides users with an ability to track and monitor their food inventory with the convenience of predefined or custom timing reminders. With a reminder to the user encouraging them to use their food, the user can help lower the levels of American food waste through personal action, saving money, and even reducing the environmental by-products of food waste.  Don’t Waste It! aims to bring attention to the amount of food waste in the U.S. as well as contribute to the reduction and elimination of food waste.
